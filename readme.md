## Refugees and Terrorism in Southeast Asia

### About this map
This web map features a choropleth polygon layer showing the number of refugees by country of origin in 2019. For any given country, this value represents how many refugees that this country has "produced"-- this number only includes refugees that fall under the UNHCR's legal definition of refugee. This differs from the total number of forcibly displaced individuals in each country.

The second layer on this web map is a point class layer showing terrorism events in 2019 across Southeast Asia.
